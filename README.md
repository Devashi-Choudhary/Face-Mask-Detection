# Face-Mask-Detector
The novel COVID-19 virus has forced us all to rethink how we live our everyday lives while keeping ourselves and others safe. Face masks have emerged as a simple and effective strategy for reducing the virusâ€™s threat and also, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Therefore, the goal of the project is to develop face mask detector using deep learning.

# Dependencies
Deep Learning based Face-Mask-Detector architecture uses [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (opencv==4.2.0) and Python (python==3.7). The model Convolution Neural Network(CNN) uses [Keras](https://keras.io/) (keras==2.3.1) on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (tensorflow>=1.15.2). For face detection in images it uses [caffe based model](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). Also, imutils==0.5.3, numpy==1.18.2, matplotlib==3.2.1, argparse==1.1 are also used.

# How to execute code:
1. You will first have to download the repository and then extract the contents into a folder.
2. Make sure you have the correct version of Python installed on your machine. This code runs on Python 3.6 above.
3. Install all dependencies mentioned above.
